# 3.DETERMINATION-OF-VOLTAGE-IN-CIRCUIT-USING-NODAL-ANALYSIS

**NAME:SRI RUDHRA S**

**REFERENCE NO:25002861**

**AIM:**

To determine the voltage in the circuit using nodal analysis both theoretically and practically for a given DC circuit.

**APPARATUS REQUIRED:**

1.	Regulated Power supply ( RPS)	(0-30 V)	1

2.	Multimeter	---	1

3.	Resistors	470Ω,330Ω	3,2

4.	Bread board	---	1

**THEORY:**

In electric circuits analysis, nodal analysis, node-voltage analysis, or the branch current method is a method of determining the voltage (potential difference) between "nodes" (points where elements or branches connect) in an electrical circuit in terms of the branch currents.

**PROCEDURE:**

1.	Give connections as per the circuit diagram.

2.	Switch ON the supply, vary the RPS (Regulated Power Supply) and set a particular input voltage.

3.	Note down the readings of ammeters and voltmeters and tabulate them.

4.	Vary the RPS for different input voltages and note down the readings of all the meters.

5.	Reduce the RPS to its minimum value and switch OFF the supply.

6.	Using the tabulated values, verify Kirchoff’s laws practically, and verify it theoretically.

**RESULT:**

Thus, the Nodal analysis is verified practically and theoretically. The resultant voltages for 	V supply are:

a)	The voltage V1 is	0.67V.

b)	The voltage V2 is	0.18V.

c)	The voltage V3 is	0.42V.
